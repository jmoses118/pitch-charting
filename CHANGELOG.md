# Changelog

## Unreleased
### Changed (refactor, no behavior change)
- Split `logic.js` into core modules under `js/core/` (grid, calls, game, scoring, csv, sync, store); `logic.js` is now the node entry point.
- Single severity source: `missData` uses `pitchMiss`; shared `GOOD_MAX_SEV`/`isGoodSev` used by stats drill-down.
- Removed dead waste-in-zone code and leftovers.
- Added README, docs (architecture, scoring, testing), Supabase migrations, CI workflow. SW cache v28.
